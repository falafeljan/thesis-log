A couple of weeks ago, my thesis supervisor Prof. Dr. Gregory Crane suggested to me visiting the IIIF Conference 2019, which fortunately took place in beautiful Göttingen, Germany. It has been a fantastic opportunity to actually get to know the impact of IIIF as a technology to create a standardized layer for organizing image data within and among institutions on a global scale.

I went for the [IIIF showcase](https://iiif.io/event/2019/goettingen/showcase/), which provided a wide variety of input on applications such as IIIF and museums (Emmanuelle Delmas-Glass), IIIF for research and Digital Humanities (Regine Stein), or IIIF and newspapers (Karen Estlund). The amount of prestigious institutions visiting Göttingen also hugely impressed me, with researchers present from Yale Center of British Art, Stanford University, University of Tokyo, Leipzig University (hah!), and many more.

Also, I was very lucky to meet [Edward Silverton](https://twitter.com/edsilv) over a cup of coffee. Edward is leading the development of [Universal Viewer](https://universalviewer.io/), a web application that is capable of displaying IIIF content by utilizing the IIIF Presentation API. He also made some efforts linking up Universal Viewer and the [Dat](https://dat.foundation/) peer-to-peer protocol as part of [uv.pub](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/uv.pub), enabling for a personal, decentralized media publishing workflow.

Overall, the conference encouraged me to further explore the various applications of IIIF and learn more about researchers’ workflows with that technology, ultimately finding opportunities where decentralization would matter. Also, judging from Edward’s positive feedback on my thesis proposal, I’ll be starting to build a prototype application for sharing IIIF[^Version 3 of IIIF utilizes the new W3C Annotation Model.] annotations among a decentralized network, based upon Dat’s [hypercore stack](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore)[^hypercore implements a distributed append-only log, developed by [Mathias Buus et al.](https://github.com/datprotocol/DEPs/blob/master/proposals/0002-hypercore.md), and is part of Dat’s technology stack.].
