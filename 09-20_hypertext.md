Last week, [Johannes](https://twitter.com/codeislego) and I visited the ACM Conference for Hypertext and Social Media, [HT'09](https://human.iisys.de/ht2019/), in Hof, Germany. We had a fantastic time---a research project that emerged from a student project at one of [Gregory Crane's](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/about/who/gregoryCrane) labs at Leipzig University's Digital Humanities chair [made it to a short paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3343667) got accepted at HT'09.

Language barriers, so to say, were just one kind of walls the conference aimed at tearing down. Our paper discussed preliminary work on [a project dubbed 'Mediating Hafiz'](/mediating-hafiz), where we describe an approach for combining Citizen Science (learnersourcing, in particular; [Kim, 2015](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/101464)) and computational transliteration methods for tackling ambiguity in the Persian language, Farsi. By incorporting audio as second modality to script, we basically created a spatially and temporally aligned corpus---micro-level hypermedia, basically.


## Tearing Down the Wall: Hypertext Fiction

Being born around the time Tim Berners-Lee presented [his popular work on hypertext](TODO), HTTP and HTML, I honestly missed most of the ideas that circle around hypertext up until recently---hypertext fiction, hypermedia narrative, and many more. Workshops like [HUMAN](https://human.iisys.de/human19/program/) (Human Factors in Hypertext) and [NHT](http://nht.ecs.soton.ac.uk/2019/programme.htm) (Narrative and Hypertext) convered work on combining both classical notions of hypertext, like hypertext fiction written in HTML, and experimental narrative techniques, like Augmented Reality (AR).

HT'19 also did a fantastic job at covering the artistic side of hypertext. In an exhibition by Dene Grigar, ["Tear Down the Wall: Hypertext and Participatory Narratives"](http://dtc-wsuv.org/tear-down-the-wall/),  eight works by hyperfiction artists were presented throughout the conference. With 'Sound Spheres', John Barber and Greg Philbrook experiment with a narrative notion of audio, where users can choose which audio spheres to compose in their individual experience. Mez Breeze conceived virtual reality scenes for "A Place Called Ormalcy", which complement text-based short stories. And John McDaid realized non-linear storytelling, consisting of multiple strands within a lovely fictive world in "We Knew The Glass Man". This work has also been read by him, with choices from the audience on which strand to take, in a live Hyperfiction Traversal.


## HT'02: Peer-to-Peer Hypertext

In terms of my [thesis work](https://kassel.works/thesis), I've had some splendid experiences. Originally, the submissions of Jakob Voß about an imagination of Ted Nelson's Xanadu hypertext system with contemporary technology like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [IIIF](https://iiif.io/), and hypothes.is for realizing transclusion and content location got me to actually read into Nelson's work from the 60s. It struck with me, as distributed data structures such as [Dat's hypercore](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore) address some of Xanadu's principles.

This again led to the notion that early visions of hypertext didn't necessarily imagined these heavily centralized networks that we face these days, with Facebook basically being an often-cited, majorly self-contained hypermedia silo. A panel from HT'02 in Maryland called ["Peer-to-Peer Hypertext"](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=513338.513339), led be Uffe Wiil, finally pulled the trigger on me. By meeting Niels Bouvin from University of Aarhus, one of the 2002 panelists who also attended this year's HT'19, I was finally able to move beyond the short stances of the panel summary, with work merging principles from hypertext and P2P such as [Cubit]. Niels himself gave a report on contemporary hypermedia software like Jupyter Notebooks and the [Webstrates collaboration platform](https://webstrates.net/).
