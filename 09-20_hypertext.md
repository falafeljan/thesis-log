Last week, [Johannes](https://twitter.com/codeislego) and I visited the ACM Conference for Hypertext and Social Media, [HT'09](https://human.iisys.de/ht2019/), in Hof, Germany. We had a fantastic time---a research project that emerged from a student project at one of [Gregory Crane's](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/about/who/gregoryCrane) labs at Leipzig University's Digital Humanities chair [made it to a short paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3343667) got accepted at HT'09.

The paper discussed preliminary work on a project dubbed 'Mediating Hafiz', conducted by [Maryam Foradi](http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/team/), [Johannes Pein](https://twitter.com/codeislego), Gregory Crane, and myself beginning in early 2019. We tackled the issue of disambiguation when attempting to translate words from the Persian language Farsi to, for instance, English: in Farsi, the three short vowels *a*, *e*, and *o*, aren't commonly written. This bears issues for language learners: To properly translate and pronounce a word, you need contextual knowledge on which meaning it actually has. The Arabic language shares this ambiguity. For example, the arabic word <TODO> translates to both the dish [hummus](TODO) and the city of [Homs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homs). We attempt at incorporating transliterations into the Interational Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), crowdsourcing, and temporally aligned spoken Farsi to achieve two particular goals: First, making language learners gaining language skills. Second, gathering training data for computational translitation methods. The preliminary results we discussed hinted at possibilities for learning effects we want to study in the future.

Language barriers, so to say, were just one kind of walls the conference aimed at tearing down.

## Tearing Down the Wall: Hypertext Fiction
Being born around the time Tim Berners-Lee presented [his popular work on hypertext](TODO), HTTP and HTML, I honestly missed most of the ideas that circle around hypertext up until recently---hypertext fiction, hypermedia narrative, and many more. Workshops like [HUMAN](https://human.iisys.de/human19/program/) (Human Factors in Hypertext) and [NHT](http://nht.ecs.soton.ac.uk/2019/programme.htm) (Narrative and Hypertext) did work on combining both classical notions of hypertext and narrative techniques.

## HT'02: Peer-to-Peer Hypertext
In terms of my [thesis work](https://kassel.works/thesis), I've had some splendid experiences. Originally, the submissions of Jakob Voß about an imagination of Ted Nelson's Xanadu hypertext system with contemporary technology like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [IIIF](https://iiif.io/), and hypothes.is for realizing transclusion and content location got me to actually read into Nelson's work from the 60s. It struck with me, as distributed data structures such as [Dat's hypercore](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore) address some of Xanadu's principles.

This again led to the notion that early visions of hypertext didn't necessarily imagined these heavily centralized networks that we face these days, with Facebook basically being an often-cited, majorly self-contained hypermedia silo. [A panel from HT'02](TODO) in Maryland called "Peer-to-Peer Hypertext", led be Uffe Wiil, finally pulled the trigger on me. By meeting Niels Bouvin from University of Aarhus, one of the 2002 panelists who also attended this year's HT'19, I was finally able to move beyond the short stances of the panel summary, with work merging principles from hypertext and P2P such as [Cubit]. Niels himself gave a report on contemporary hypermedia software like Jupyter Notebooks and the [Webstrates collaboration platform](TODO).
