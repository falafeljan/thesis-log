## Tearing Down the Wall: Hypertext Fiction
Being born around the time Tim Berners-Lee presented his popular work on hypertext, HTTP and HTML, I honestly missed most of the ideas that circle around hypertext---fiction, narrative, hypermedia (TODO)

## HT'02: Peer-to-Peer Hypertext
In terms of my [thesis work](TODO), I've made some splendid experiences. Originally, the submissions of Jakob Voß about an imagination of Ted Nelson's Xanadu hypertext system with contemporary technology like IPFS, IIIF, and hypothes.is for realizing transclusion and content location got me to actually read into Nelson's work from the 60s. It struck with me, as distributed data structures such as [Dat's hypercore](TODO) address some of Xanadu's principles.

This again led to the notion that early visions of hypertext didn't necessarily imagined these heavily centralized networks that we face these days, with Facebook basically being an often-cited, majorly self-contained hypermedia silo. [A panel from HT'02](TODO) in Maryland called "Peer-to-Peer Hypertext", led be Uffe Wiil, finally pulled the trigger on me. By meeting Niels Bouvin from University of Aarhus, one of the 2002 panelists who also attended this year's HT'19, I was finally able to move beyond the short stances of the panel summary, with work merging principles from hypertext and P2P such as [Cubit]. Niels himself gave a report on contemporary hypermedia software like Jupyter Notebooks and the [Webstrates collaboration platform](TODO).
